🌟 Règle de Trois - Traditional Senegalese Board Game
A modern, full-stack implementation of the traditional Senegalese board game "Règle de Trois" built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Express. This project demonstrates advanced web development concepts including real-time multiplayer gameplay, responsive design, and secure backend architecture.

🎮 About the Game
Règle de Trois is a traditional strategy board game from Senegal, similar to Tic-Tac-Toe but with enhanced mechanics:

Players: 2 players with 3 pawns each
Board: Star-shaped grid with 9 intersection points
Gameplay: Two phases - placement and movement
Objective: First player to align 3 pawns in a row wins

🚀 Features
Completed ✅

🚦 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (v18 or higher)
npm or yarn
Git

Installation

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/Mourtish/regle-de-trois-game.git
cd regle-de-trois-game

Set up the backend
bashcd backend
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

npm run dev

Set up the frontend (in a new terminal)
bashcd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Access the application

Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:3001



Development Workflow
bash# Start both servers in development mode
npm run dev:backend   # Terminal 1
npm run dev:frontend  # Terminal 2

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
🎯 Game Rules
Phase 1: Placement

Players alternate placing their 3 pawns on empty intersection points
Strategic placement is crucial for Phase 2 positioning

Phase 2: Movement

Players alternate moving one pawn along connected lines
Only moves to adjacent empty positions are allowed
First player to align 3 pawns horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins

Winning Conditions

Horizontal: Three pawns in a row across the board
Vertical: Three pawns in a column
Diagonal: Three pawns along diagonal lines

🔒 Security Features

Input validation and sanitization
CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
Environment variable protection
Future: JWT authentication and rate limiting

🌐 Deployment
Current Status
